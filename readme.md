# Dotnet Pantry Example

## How to Build and Run

### Visual Studio

Pressing start (F5) will restore packages, build the project, and start the server.

If Visual Studio complains about the missing packages; right-click the solution, click Restore NuGet Packages, then click run once the packages have been restored.

### Visual Studio Code

Open the folder in the command prompt and run `dotnet restore && dotnet run`.
